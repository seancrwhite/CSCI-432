\maketitle

For this paper we are examining the convex hull algorithm created by Timothy Chan in 1996. This algorithm that takes n points on a graph and seeks to create the smallest possible polygon that encloses all points. We will be comparing it to the miniball algorithm outlined in class as they are similar processes that solve somewhat different problems
